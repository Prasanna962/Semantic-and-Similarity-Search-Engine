# Semantic-and-Similarity-Search-Engine
🔍✨ Semantic & Similarity Search Pipeline
Ever wanted to find the exact match or the most relevant content in a huge dataset? Whether it’s text, images, or audio, this project uses AI and deep learning to search smarter—and faster!

📅 Timeline: Aug 2023 – Oct 2023
⚡ Tech Stack: Python | VSCode | Hugging Face Transformers | PyTorch | TensorFlow | Milvus | Docker | Pandas

🌟 What’s This About?
This is a semantic and similarity search pipeline designed to help you search and retrieve data in a way that’s more meaningful and relevant. Whether you're working with text, images, or audio, this system transforms your data into vector embeddings and makes it easy to query based on similarity and semantic meaning.

You can search for:

Contextually relevant text
Visually similar images
Closely matching audio
All in real-time, powered by Milvus and deep learning embeddings!

🔹 What Makes This Cool?
📌 1. Data Preprocessing & Embedding Generation
🔹 I processed 500K+ CSV records, 100K images, and 10K audio files using Pandas and turned them into vector embeddings using Hugging Face’s Sentence Transformers.

📌 2. Fast & Scalable Vector Storage
🔹 I set up Milvus inside Docker to store and retrieve vectors quickly and efficiently. This setup makes it easy to scale and handle big data!

📌 3. Smart Search Techniques
🔹 This system isn’t just about finding the exact match—it can also find content that’s semantically relevant or similar using:

Semantic Search → Finds content that matches the meaning of your query
Similarity Search → Finds the most closely related items
🔹 I also tested different similarity metrics to ensure the search is fast and accurate.

📌 4. Intelligent Retrieval
🔹 I built a search mechanism that uses methods like:

Cosine Similarity
Euclidean Distance
FAISS Indexing
